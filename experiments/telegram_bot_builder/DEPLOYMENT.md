# DirectPilot TelBot — current UAT deployment guide

## 2026-10-19 — PR #68 deployment LIVE ON OFFICIAL TELBOT UAT ALIAS (new verified checkpoint)

**Supersedes the earlier 402/quota blocker, which is no longer the current deployment state.** Read-only Vercel verification: independent project `directpilot-telbot-uat-api`, deployment `dpl_HKaapwTGMPbo5H3x6gWZWXtYybXj` has **READY** state on source SHA `fe76fd7aa68e5d4ae5baf89ed824cf325937a8e0`; public alias `directpilot-telbot-uat-api.vercel.app` is attached to this exact deployment. GitHub main CI and isolated TelBot CI for PR #68 head `981a9033de7a1d3c8122ba61f8b69b24de982486` are both **SUCCESS**.

PR #68 was merged at `b9228213d1ac3cb02bd2157964ee1436ad15cec4`. The deployed source contains `is_uat_host` checking the configured Neon UAT pooled hostname and its direct equivalent before `psycopg.connect`, denying other hosts with 503 `TelBot UAT database endpoint mismatch`. No production data or Telegram send changed.

Vercel production-target variables on this TelBot-only UAT project: `TELBOT_ENV=uat`, `TELBOT_UAT_DB_HOST=ep-wandering-heart-ar7z3k0s-pooler.c-4.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech`, Sensitive `TELBOT_UAT_DATABASE_URL` (value inaccessible; key last updated 2026-10-19). This verifies presence and release configuration, **NOT successful runtime DB connection**. Attempts to retrieve HTTPS `/ready` and `/live` from assistant environment were blocked by network access; user HTTP smoke needed.

**Next mandatory UAT acceptance:** request `https://directpilot-telbot-uat-api.vercel.app/ready` after this deployment; log status/body and differentiate: `TelBot UAT database endpoint mismatch` = URL wrong Neon branch; `TelBot UAT schema unavailable` = connected DB has missing/invisible UAT marker; `TelBot UAT database unavailable` = DB credential/connection failure; `Telegram manager not configured` = DB marker and migration passed but Manager secrets missing; 200 = readiness only, not Telegram E2E. Prior schema 503 predates this active host guard and cannot be treated as the latest result. Do not ask user to expose any secrets. T1 PARTIAL; Manager Bot/live Telegram not configured; independent TelBot Neon Production and Instagram DirectPilot Production untouched.

## 2026-10-19 — TelBot PR #68 merged; Vercel quota blocks official UAT release

- PR [#68](https://github.com/namach2727-coder/Sales-Agent/pull/68) **MERGED** into isolated TelBot branch at Git commit `b9228213d1ac3cb02bd2157964ee1436ad15cec4`. Change: verify Neon URL host against TelBot UAT endpoint BEFORE connecting and fail closed with `TelBot UAT database endpoint mismatch`; offline UAT/direct vs non-UAT tests are present. Isolated TelBot CI for PR head **SUCCESS**; general CI was still running on last inspection and must not be claimed PASS yet.
- Vercel PR preview `dpl_HPUL37DKrN6bUKmR4WcDdLvSvdvM` on PR head is READY, **target=preview**. The database secret in Vercel is **production target only for this separate UAT project**. Do **NOT** promote the preview, since it does not establish inherited Production credentials.
- The official alias `directpilot-telbot-uat-api.vercel.app` **still points** to `dpl_7NaicKji7PfacmDxUatz3qfNw7VZ` on earlier SHA `5b22aac649251ad5856a28c22bc27e9875855044`, so live `/ready` does NOT yet include the host guard. Explicit production-target deployment of merge SHA `b9228213` failed: Vercel HTTP 402 `api-deployments-free-per-day`, retry-after 86400 seconds. **NO official runtime fix, no DB readiness PASS.**
- New deployment must wait until Vercel Hobby quota resets or owner makes a billing/plan decision. Recheck the exact source SHA, deployment state and alias after quota recovery, then ask owner to retest `/ready`. If `TelBot UAT database endpoint mismatch` appears, Vercel Sensitive URL points outside configured Neon UAT endpoint; owner must safely reselect Neon project `directpilot-telbot`, branch `uat`, database `telbot`, temporary role `telbot_owner`. Never paste URL/secret. If `Telegram manager not configured` appears, DB schema gate passed, not full app readiness.
- No Instagram DirectPilot Production, independent TelBot Neon Production, real Telegram webhook/message or customer data touched. Keep T1 PARTIAL and Manager Bot PENDING.

## 2026-10-19 — TelBot UAT repeated schema 503 diagnostic and endpoint guard

**Observed:** After Vercel environment update and redeploy `dpl_7NaicKji7PfacmDxUatz3qfNw7VZ` READY, owner still saw HTTP 503 `TelBot UAT schema unavailable`. Read-only Neon UAT `br-tiny-poetry-arz49v2o` shows `telbot.manager_inbound_updates`, migration `0002_webhook_auth`, and both runtime/owner have schema usage and marker SELECT; TelBot Neon production `br-fancy-feather-arydwgj7` has zero tables. This strongly suggests the Vercel **Sensitive** DB URI targets a different branch, but its actual hostname cannot be read with the connector; **root cause remains unverified until endpoint guard response**.

**Correction PR candidate:** isolated branch `fix/telbot-uat-db-branch-host-guard-20261019`, `api.py` now fails closed before psycopg connection unless the URI host matches `TELBOT_UAT_DB_HOST` or its UAT direct equivalent; rejects libpq `host`/`hostaddr` URL overrides. New offline `test_uat_connection_host.py` checks UAT pooled/direct PASS, non-UAT PROD DENY, malformed/missing configuration DENY. No DB migration, credentials, webhooks, production integrations or Telegram messages touched.

**Acceptance gate:** GitHub isolated CI SUCCESS, PR merge into TelBot isolated branch, matching Vercel READY + alias, then owner retry `/ready`. If `TelBot UAT database endpoint mismatch`, **update the Sensitive `TELBOT_UAT_DATABASE_URL` in Vercel to Neon project directpilot-telbot / branch uat / database telbot / temporary role telbot_owner**, redeploy and retry. Never paste secret; do not copy schema into production. If `Telegram manager not configured`, UAT DB/schema check PASS but overall readiness still HTTP 503. Otherwise diagnose role/schema separately. Manager Bot not configured and no live outbound permitted. Checklist and six canonical docs synchronized; previous historical records retained.

**Last verified 2026-10-19.** Independent Vercel project `directpilot-telbot-uat-api`; Git connected to `feature/telegram-managed-bots-spike-20261017`; Root Directory `experiments/telegram_bot_builder`; framework `fastapi`. Native root `app.py` exports the FastAPI app from `api.py`. PR #66 removed obsolete catch-all rewrite to `/api/index.py`, which previously masked `/live` with a 404.

PRs #64 dependencies, #66 routing, #67 temporary UAT owner database acceptance MERGED. Source `bd20c44a883a4de3f57ca2f9d009b8d981519c18`; [Vercel deployment](https://vercel.com/mohcenp-9857s-projects/directpilot-telbot-uat-api/DYjA434LnV79oYHDnXSHW36dXAL6) READY and alias `https://directpilot-telbot-uat-api.vercel.app` verified.

## Secrets and data access
- UAT Neon project `curly-cell-93038441`, UAT branch `br-tiny-poetry-arz49v2o`, DB `telbot`. SSL required; pooled connection appropriate for serverless, direct for migrations.
- Vercel env keys present: `TELBOT_ENV=uat`, Sensitive `TELBOT_UAT_DATABASE_URL`, `TELBOT_UAT_DB_HOST`. Presence does **not** validate connection.
- Code temporarily accepts `telbot_owner` in UAT with environment, database and UAT marker guards; this role has elevated CREATEDB/CREATEROLE and must be replaced by least-privileged `telbot_ua_runtime` before real customers.
- Missing as last inventoried: `TELBOT_MANAGER_TOKEN`, `TELBOT_MANAGER_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `TELBOT_TOKEN_FERNET_KEY`. Manager Bot owner must set these securely, never paste them in chat/Git.

## Acceptance diagnostics
- `/live` previously owner tested PASS with expected JSON after PR #66.
- `/ready` has **not** been retested since #67; `TelBot UAT database unavailable` means DB failing; `Telegram manager not configured` means DB/schema checks succeeded but Manager secrets missing. Neither is HTTP 200.
- `/` returning 404 is not by itself a health failure. Build READY != database ready or Telegram end-to-end ready.

See [Master Checklist](../../docs/telegram_bot_builder/TELBOT_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md); no Production Instagram or TelBot Neon Production changes authorized.
